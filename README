This project implements an algorithm for creating polyphonic music,
described here: http://subsumption.jansson.me.uk and here:
http://rootnote.blogspot.com/2011/03/using-subsumption-architecture-for.html.

There are two parts to this project, a music generation module and a
synthesiser module. The music module consists of the system.[ch] and
agent.[ch] files, and the synth module can be found in synth.[ch].

The whole thing is tied together in source.c. In the main loop notes
are being read from the music module and these notes are then fed to
the synth module which fills up audio buffers. These buffers are then
outputted to stdout in 16-bit little endian format, a format that can
be read by the Ices2 stdinpcm input module. (I named the file source.c
to be compliant with Ices2 terminology.)

NOTE: In order to compile you need to have libconfig installed. I used
libconfig-1.4.7, obtained from
http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/. (The libconfig version that is
in the Ubuntu 10.10 repositories does not work.)
